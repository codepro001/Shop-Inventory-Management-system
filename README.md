Hello! Welcome to my first project in python. 
This is the Shop Inventory Management System where you can easily manage your shop details. 
It reduces the work of a shop manager by maintaining the shop. 
We can easily maintain the product, employees and suppliers through this project in an interactive way. 
This is my college project you can fork it to modify and build your own project. 

Steps are: 
1. Copy the project to your code editor.
2. Make a database and put your username and password(because I had made it on MySQL database).
3. Run The Project.
